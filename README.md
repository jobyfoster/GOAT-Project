# GOAT-Project
U3M2 Project

I made this project for Module 2 of my 3rd unit at BCCA.
The project objective was to build a small, informational website honoring the greatest of all time (GOAT) for a domain of your choosing.

I chose Jeff Bezos because I admire his drive and ability to take dominate industries.
