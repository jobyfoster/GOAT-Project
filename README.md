# GOAT-Project
U3M2 Project

I made this project for Module 2 of my 3rd unit at BCCA.
The project objective was to build a small, informational website honoring the greatest of all time (GOAT) for a domain of your choosing.

I chose Jeff Bezos because I admire his drive and ability to take dominate industries.

## For Mrs. Brittany:
I made the CSS for this website for a day before realizing you said not to.
Please comment out the link to the stylesheet if it violates the rubric.
If you want me to resubmit with the CSS in a <style> tag instead please let me know, thank you.
